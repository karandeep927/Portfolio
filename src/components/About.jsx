      Hey there! I'm Karandeep, a tech enthusiast and frontend developer who loves to create innovative solutions and explore the world of technology. With a strong background in React, Node.js, MongoDB, and Python, I enjoy building user-friendly web applications and crafting clean, efficient code.
I’ve also worked on several projects. While I enjoy coding and keeping up with innovations in AI and machine learning, I also find peace in nature. In my free time, I indulge in gardening and love working on my family's land, balancing my passion for tech with a love for plants and nature.
Currently, I'm on an exciting journey to develop an AI system, inspired by Iron Man’s ‘Friday,’ blending my technical expertise with creativity.
Feel free to explore my work, and let's connect!
